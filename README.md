=========

DarkHorse is a simple, lightweight plugin that lets you spawn all types
of rideable beasts in Minecraft, INCLUDING the "darker" horses in the
game. That's right - zombie and skeleton horses! Using a simple set of
commands, you can spawn in these mobs immediately and shock people with
the unnatural horses!

And now, not only can you spawn all the types of horses, you can even
ride them too! Spawn a tamed horse, right-click with a saddle, and travel
through the countryside on your noble undead steed!
